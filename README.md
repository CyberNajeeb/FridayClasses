#### Clear Console Hack
Since there is no conventional way of clearing console for Intelij, I had to apply a hack.
Here is how to apply it.

You could assign a shortcut to Clear All on the Console from `Preferences > Keymap.` In the following screenshot I am assigning the shortcut `ALT SHIFT 1` to clear the console.

To test this just place your cursor in the console and use that keystroke combination.

This particular solution is taken from [Solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46102201/is-it-possible-to-clear-the-console-tab-during-runtime-in-intellij-with-java)
